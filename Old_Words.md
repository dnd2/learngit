### Grammar

**1. 基本句型**

	* 五种单句的基本句型
		* S + V (主语 + 动词)
		* S + V + O (主语 + 动词 + 宾语)
		* S + V + C (主语 + 动词 + 补语)
		* S + V + O + O (主语 + 动词 + 宾语 + 宾语) 
		* S + V + O + C (主语 + 动词 + 宾语 + 补语)
		
		* 在所有的英语动词中，只有解释为"是"的动词是空的，完全没有意义。没有叙述能力，只能扮演引导叙述部分的角色
			* John Smith was a soldier 动词was并未指出John Smith的任何事情。叙述主要内容放在后面的a soldier上。was只是起着连接作用。
			* John Smith was courageous. 此句体现更为突出
			* The soup is too hot.
			* 英语中is是动词不能丢掉，但却缺乏叙述能力。只能把主语和后面构成叙述的部分连接起来，叫做"连缀动词(Linking Verb)",跟在这种动词后的部分，因替代了动词扮演的叙述角色，补足句子使它获得完整的意思，称之为"补语(Complement)"
	* 需要补语的动词 (凡接补语的动词都可解释为各种各样的"是")
		* look 看起来是 - That dress looks pretty.
		* seem 似乎是   - The dog seems firendly.
		* appear 显得是 - His demands appear reasonable. (他的要求显得很合理)
		* sound 听起来是 - His trip sounds exciting. (他的旅行听起来很刺激)
		* feel 摸起来是 - I feel sick
		* taste 尝起来是 - The drug tastes bitter (药很苦)
		* turn 转变为  
		* prove 证实为 - The story proved false. (故事正是是捏造的)
		* become 成为  - He became a teacher.
		* make 做为    - A nurse makes a good wife. (娶护士做太太真不错)

		* 以上句子全部换位be动词，意思和句型没有太大变化。 这就是S + V + C 的句型。凡动词解释为各种各样的"是"的句子都属于此类型。
	
	* 宾语补语的句型(S + V + O + C) - 用补语告诉读者宾语是什么，中间暗示有一个"是"的关系存在。
		* I find the dress pretty. 
			* the dress是宾语，pretty是补语，中间虽没有"是"，但带有这种暗示的存在 
		* The meat made the dog friendly. 肉让狗变得很友善
		* They consider his demands reasonable. 他们认为他的要是合理的
		* He found the trip exciting.
		* The food made me sick. 这种食物使我想吐
		* I don't find the drug bitter. 我并不觉得药很苦
		* I consider the story false.  我认为故事是捏造的
		* His college training made him a teacher.
		* Most people consider a nurse a good wife.
	
		* 验证S + V + O + C句型最简单的方法，把宾语和补语拿出来，中间加be动词，看是否能改成S + V + C
	
	* 补语的词类
		* 一般为名词和形容词，因为主语和宾语都是名词，所以补语也可以是名词，经由"是"连接表达同等关系。  
	
	* 没有补语的be动词
		* 如果be动词后无补语，表示它并不是做连缀动词用，此时，be动词并不解释为"是"，而需要解释为"存在"，用在最单纯的"S + V"句型中。  
			* 笛卡尔说的"我思故为我在"，I think,therefore I am. 在翻译时I am不能翻成"我是"，此处因为"我存在"

	* S + V + O + O
		* John's father(S) gave(V) him(O) a dog(O).  
		* gave做"给"的动作，首先要有个东西，然后要有接受者(即him)，这2个宾语，一个是给的对象，一个是给的东西，2个都是名词，但并不相同。需要区分S + V + O + C句型，宾语和补语也可以是名词，但宾语和补语间不存有"等于是"的关系。
			* John's father(S) called(V) him(O) a dog(C). 
	
	* 分析句型属于哪一种
		* The magician moved his fingers quickly.
		* The police found the letter missing.
		* He ordered himself a steak and a bottle of red wine. 
		* Don't you like dancing?
		* The president has gone abroad on a visit.
		* That sounds like a good idea.
		* The box feels heavy.
		* He told his guests a dirty joke at the party.
		* The people elected Bill Clinton President.
		* The company has gone bankrupt.
		* Why don't you answer me?
		* I consider you a member of the family.
		* You'll look better with these designer glasses on.
		* I can see better without these reading glasses.
		* Do you call me a liar?

**2. 名词词组与冠词**

	* 在名词短语开头，有些符合来配合标识该名词的范围，在语言学上成为"限定词(Determiners)"。它与词尾单复数符合相互呼应共同determine名词的范围，冠词为其中一种
		*  a new book 
		*  many good students
		*  his beautiful wife
		*  the best answer
		*  those sweet roses
		*  以上名词短语由3部分组成，(a,many,his等)即限定词，指出名词的范围。中间的adjective做修饰语，是可有可无的元素。
			* a new book 去掉new -> a book,仍然正确
			* the best answer 去掉名词 -> the best 同样正确
				* 如: Of these answers, this one is best. * 从中可以知道the best就是the best asnwer
			* those sweet roses 去掉形容词和名词 -> those，仍然正确  
	* 什么时候不需要使用限定词 
		* 冠词a(an)可视为one弱化结果。 a(an)代表one的意思只是语气较弱。a(an)与one同样交代它后面所接名词是"一个"的概念。如果后面的名词不适合以一个来表示，就不用加a(an)a(an)
			* Unmarried men are a rare species these days.
			* 名词短语Unmarried men只有形容词和名词2个部分，没有限定词，因为men已表明是复数
			* a new book book是单数形态，因此需要加限定词配合标示它   
		* 不能使用限定词a(an)表示的名词类型:
			* 复数名词
			* 抽象名词(honesty，bribery)没有具体形态不能表示一个之意。
			* 物质名词(water, food)，虽具体东西，但形态不固定，不能用"一个"表示
				* Honesty is not necessarily the best policy.
				* Fresh water is a precious resource in Saudi Arabia. 
	* 专有名词与补语位置 (人名、地名都为专有名词,因为代表的对象为一个)
		* 一个名词不能加-s也不能加a(an)，专有名词就是如此。 
		* 补语和主语(或宾语)之间有同等关系，如果主语(或宾语)是专有名词，那么它的补语既然和它等同，则也会被当做专有名词来使用，条件是补语位置的名词需具有"唯一"性质。
			* Mr. Elson was president of the high school.
			* Some say he was a better president than Mr. Robert. 
				* 此处的从句补语president前加了一个a，这是因为上下文中和Mr. Robert做比较，这么一来就有前后两任校长，可以加-s,不是专有名词了。 
			* Mr. Elson is also a memeber of the Council of the city. 埃尔森先生也是该城市政会委员
				* a memeber of the Council做补语，高中校长同一时间只有1个人，但市政委员有很多人，a member需要交代是"一名"，而非专有名词。
